            <p>
              Italy is a boot-shaped peninsula that juts out of southern Europe
              into the Adriatic Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and
              other waters. Its location has played an important role in its
              history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sea surrounds Italy, and mountains crisscross the interior,
              dividing it into regions. The Alps cut across the top of the
              country and are streaked with long, thin glacial lakes. From the
              western end of the Alps, the Apennines mountains stretch south
              down the entire peninsula.
            </p>
            <p>
              West of the Apennines are wooded hills that are home to many of
              Italy's historic cities, including Rome. In the south are hot, dry
              coastlands and fertile plains where olives, almonds, and figs are
              grown.
            </p>

            <img
              src="../img/Italy/italy2.jpg"
              alt="City view of Italy"
              class="img-fluid py-3"
            />
            <br />
            <h2 class="py-3">When to go</h2>
            <p>
              The best time to visit Italy is during spring (March-May) and
              autumn (September-November), when the temperatures are comfortable
              and there are fewer crowds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wildflowers in early April and rising temperatures through to the
              end of June are a real draw. From October, the summer heat eases
              off, the grape harvest is in full swing, and the cities are
              quieter for sightseeing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Temperatures in the south remain mild in winter. While it is the
              off-season and some attractions have limited opening hours, it's
              still an enjoyable time to explore many of the country's
              historical sites. Winters in northern Italy, however, are normally
              wet and cold.
            </p>
            <p>
              The summer months of July and August see higher temperatures and
              visitor numbers reach their peak. Prices are also higher.
            </p>

            <h2 class="py-3">Culture and customs</h2>
            <p>
              Italy boasts a cultural heritage of immense significance,
              encompassing a diverse range of artistic, culinary, and historical
              contributions that have left an indelible mark on the world. The
              birthplace of the Renaissance, Italy stands as a crucible of
              artistic genius, nurturing luminaries like Leonardo da Vinci,
              Michelangelo, and Raphael, whose masterpieces continue to
              captivate audiences globally. The country's architectural marvels,
              including the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, stand as
              testaments to Italy's enduring influence on structural design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Italian cuisine, celebrated for its emphasis on fresh, quality
              ingredients, offers a culinary journey through classics like
              pasta, pizza, and exquisite regional specialties. In the realm of
              music, Italy's legacy is profound, birthing maestros like Giuseppe
              Verdi and Antonio Vivaldi, with opera reigning as a cherished
              cultural tradition. The Italian language, noted for its
              musicality, has shaped literature, with Dante Alighieri's "Divine
              Comedy" standing as a pinnacle of literary achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Festivals such as Venetian Carnivale and Siena's Palio exemplify
              Italy's vibrant cultural calendar, while family values form the
              bedrock of social life, fostering close-knit communities. Italy's
              influence extends to the fashion world, with luxury brands like
              Gucci and Prada setting global trends, and Milan emerging as a
              crucible of innovative design. In summation, Italy's culture
              weaves a tapestry of history, art, cuisine, and tradition that
              continues to inspire and enchant people worldwide.
