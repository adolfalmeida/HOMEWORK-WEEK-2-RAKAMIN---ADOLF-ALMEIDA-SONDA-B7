            <p>
              Made up of around 1200 islands, the Maldives is hands-down one of
              the most interesting tropical destinations in the world. It first
              became popular with jet-setting celebrities a few years ago,
              particularly loved-up couples looking for a romantic getaway to a
              private tropical island.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, with more and more airlines now operating flights to the
              Maldives, it has become more affordable and accessible. It's also
              a great destination for families, with many Maldives resorts
              offering family-friendly accommodations and fun activities for
              everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, there are over 130 different Maldives resorts to choose from
              - each offering up their own slice of paradise. So how do you
              choose where to go and what to do? I've put together this article
              to give you everything you need to know so you can start planning
              your trip!
            </p>

              src="../img/Maldives/maldives2.jpg"

              class="img-fluid py-3"
            />
            <br />
            <h2 class="py-3">When to go</h2>
            <p>
              Like many tropical destinations, the Maldives only has two seasons
              - wet and dry. The dry season runs between December and March.
              This is the high season when resorts will be busier so room rates
              and flights may be a little more expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rainy season or low season, runs between June and November.
              You should expect some rain during these months, but it is mostly
              just light drizzle that passes over pretty quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Temperatures are still warm during this time, so it shouldn't
              really affect your vacation too much; plus, you can get some great
              deals on accommodation during this slightly quieter time!
            </p>
            <br />
            <img
              src="../img/Maldives/maldives3.jpg"
              alt="Maldives resorts"
              class="img-fluid py-3"
            />
            <br />
            <h2 class="py-3">Culture and customs</h2>
            <p>
              It is worth noting that the Maldives is a Muslim country, and
              there are some customs you should adhere to when visiting. You are
              not allowed to bring alcohol into the country, so definitely don't
              go crazy duty-free on your way over, as contraband will be
              confiscated and you won't be getting it back! It is also illegal
              to bring in any pork products or religious texts.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are visiting one of the local islands, then you will need
              to dress modestly in public. However, this only applies on any of
              the islands where locals live. On the Maldives resort islands, you
              are free to wear what you like.
            </p>
            <p>
              The currency in the Maldives is rufiyaa. If you're planning on
              visiting resort islands, likely, you won't even need any of this
              currency as everywhere accepts major credit and debit cards now.
              However, you may want to take some cash as tipping staff is
              customary. It's acceptable to tip in rufiyaa or US dollars. There
              are currency exchange booths and ATM machines at the airport.
