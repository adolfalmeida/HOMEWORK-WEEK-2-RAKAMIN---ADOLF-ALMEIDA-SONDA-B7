              The biggest part of the United Kingdom (also called the U.K.) is
              the island of Great Britain, which is made up of England, Wales,
              and Scotland. The U.K. also includes Northern Ireland, which is on
              another island. (South of Northern Ireland is the separate country
              of Ireland, which gained its independence from the U.K. in 1937.)
              Northern Ireland is just 12 miles from the island of Great
              Britain, across the North Channel of the Irish Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scotland and Wales are the most mountainous parts of the U.K. and
              are covered in knife-edged mountain ridges separated by deep
              valleys. This terrain was shaped some 20,000 years ago during the
              last Ice Age, when thick glaciers covered the land. When the Ice
              Age glaciers melted in northwest Scotland, they left behind
              thousands of lakes, called lochs (pronounced LOCKS). Long and
              narrow, some of the lochs are very deep. (Legends say that a giant
              monster called Nessie lives in Loch Ness in this region, also
              called the Scottish Highlands.)
            </p>
            <p>
              The largest freshwater lake by surface area in the U.K., Lough
              Neagh (pronounced LOCK NEE), is in Northern Ireland. It stretches
              20 miles long and nine miles wide. Rolling hills and plains dot
              the countryside of both Northern Ireland and England.

            <p>
              The UK is well into autumn by October, so expect grey skies,
              chilly weather, and rain. The locals don't let that stop them from
              going out for Halloween parties, food festivals, and countryside
              walks though. With a raincoat on and an umbrella in hand, you
              should be well equipped to join them and take in the best of the
              UK in autumn.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don;t mind the rain, there's plenty that makes the UK worth
              a visit this time of year. London rolls out the red carpet for its
              annual Film Festival, the homely Belfast pubs will look all the
              more inviting, and your photos of Edinburgh landmarks will have an
              effortlessly cool, mysterious vibe.
            </p>

            <h2 class="py-3">Culture and customs</h2>
            <p>
              The United Kingdom is a cultural nexus, revered for its literary
              luminaries like Shakespeare, Austen, and Dickens, and
              architectural marvels such as Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. Its
              culinary landscape, from traditional fish and chips to the
              elegance of afternoon tea, reflects a rich tapestry of tastes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The UK's musical legacy, from the Beatles to contemporary artists,
              resonates globally. Pioneering scientific minds like Newton and
              Darwin have reshaped our understanding of the world. The
              Industrial Revolution, born here, catalyzed global transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Festivals like the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Notting Hill
              Carnival exemplify the nation's dynamic arts scene, while pubs
              serve as vital social hubs. The English language, a vehicle for
              profound discourse, has left an indelible mark on human thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              The UK's cultural legacy, spanning literature, architecture,
              music, and scientific achievement, continues to captivate and
              inspire people worldwide.
