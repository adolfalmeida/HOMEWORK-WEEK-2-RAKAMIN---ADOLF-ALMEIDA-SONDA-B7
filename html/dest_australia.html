            <p>
              Australia is the only country in the world that covers an entire
              continent. It is one of the largest countries on Earth. Although
              it is rich in natural resources and has a lot of fertile land,
              more than one-third of Australia is desert.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most Australian cities and farms are located in the southwest and
              southeast, where the climate is more comfortable. There are dense
              rain forests in the northeast. The famous outback (remote rural
              areas) contains the country's largest deserts, where there are
              scorching temperatures, little water, and almost no vegetation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Running around the eastern and southeastern edge of Australia is
              the Great Dividing Range. This 2,300-mile (3,700-kilometer)
              stretch of mountain sends water down into Australia's most
              important rivers and the Great Artesian Basin, the largest
              groundwater source in the world.

            <h2 class="py-3">When to go</h2>
            <p>
              This continent has so many beautiful places to visit within
              different time zones. Hence, answering the question of when is the
              best time to visit Australia is not as easy as it seems to be. It
              entirely depends upon your interest, preferences, budget, and most
              importantly your ideal climate. From December to February, the
              beaches in Sydney seem like heaven on Earth. Summer is a great
              time in Australia to get outdoors and take a dip in the beach or
              even hike the Overland Track of Tasmania.
            </p>
            <p>
              March to May is the time for autumn when the entire town of
              Canberra lights up with the fiery foliage and Melbourne gears up
              for a Formula 1 Grand Prix. Towards the mid-end of the year, from
              June to August, the winters in Australia offer snow skiing amidst
              the Australian Alps. Otherwise, you can also opt for Snorkeling in
              the Great Barrier Reef, or even Australia's Simpson Desert is a
              great option for a perfect winter getaway. While in the spring
              from September to November you can watch out for whales and
              flowers in the wineries of Margaret River region in Western
              Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              May to October is a dry season sporting crystal blue skies and
              days gleaming with sunshine. Darwin's outdoor market, festivals,
              and movies are a great option to explore during this season. The
              wet season from December to March has some rainstorms on board
              with a climate that is hot and humid. Litchfield and Kakadu
              National Parks are the home for some grumbling waterfalls, where
              the water levels are the highest during this season.
              Alternatively, you can also fly over to Katherine George to
              witness some beautiful waterfalls of Australia.

            <h2 class="py-3">Culture and customs</h2>
            <p>
              Aussies tend to be casual and relaxed and are not very big on
              formal greetings. When meeting for the first time, generally
              Australians shake hands, smile and introduce themselves with their
              first names. They love their laid-back lifestyle and take their
              time with family and friends very seriously. Picnics, family
              barbeques, parties, a day at the beach and gatherings at the park
              are all essential to the Australian way of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Giving and exchanging gifts with family, friends, neighbours and
              workmates on birthdays and Christmas is common. If you have been
              invited to someone's home for a meal, it is polite to bring a
              bottle of wine or a box of chocolates for the hosts. Please be
              punctual as it is impolite if you are late by more than 15
              minutes. If your delay is unavoidable, contact and inform your
              host ahead of time.
