              Japan is an archipelago, or string of islands, on the eastern edge
              of Asia. There are four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku,
              and Kyushu. There are also nearly 4,000 smaller islands! Japan's
              nearest mainland neighbors are the Siberian region of Russia in
              the north and Korea and China farther south.
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost four-fifths of Japan is covered with mountains. The
              Japanese Alps run down the center of the largest island, Honshu.
              The highest peak is Mount Fuji, a cone-shaped volcano considered
              sacred by many Japanese.

            <h2 class="py-3">When to go</h2>
            <p>
              Japan, while not especially large, is surprisingly varied when it
              comes to weather. Frigid winters at the northernmost tip of
              Hokkaido make the subtropical islands of southern Okinawa seem
              worlds away. The rainy season typically runs from early June to
              mid-July throughout most of the country — Tokyo included — except
              in Okinawa where showers begin in early May. Meanwhile, in
              Hokkaido, summertime brings mild temperatures and blue skies.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you aren't hitting the ski slopes, March to May and September
              to November are generally considered the best times to visit the
              country for pleasant weather. That's when travelers can find the
              iconic cherry blossoms that seem straight out of a postcard, or,
              on the other hand, vivid autumnal leaves. During these seasons,
              rainfall is minimal, skies are clear, and temperatures are mild,
              ranging from 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit most days.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those not averse to heat and humidity, summer brings a
              different tempo to Japan. It's a time of year perfect for
              exploring nature — ideally, somewhere cool up a mountain or as far
              north as possible. The lusciously cooler climes of Hokkaido are
              heaven in the summer, with rainbow-bright flower fields and
              countless outdoor activities, from hiking to horseback riding.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the winter, the northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido is
              undeniably the best place to ski or snowboard, but areas outside
              of Tokyo, such as Niigata, are only a Shinkansen ride away and
              boast great alpine resorts. Those who prefer the warmth would do
              best to fly south to Okinawa during the winter for a more
              subtropical climate.

            <h2 class="py-3">Culture and customs</h2>
            <p>
              Japanese culture is a set of values that puts importance on social
              harmony and hard work. Up until the 10th century, Japanese culture
              was similar to the Chinese culture, but the rise of the samurai in
              the Heian Period and the isolation during the Edo Period changed
              the rules of society. Overall, the culture was influenced by the
              local Shinto religion, Buddhism, Confucianism and the limited
              natural resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Japanese lifestyle has been Westernized recently, Japanese
              people still do everything possible to preserve their rich
              cultural heritage by practicing tea ceremony, wearing kimono and
              studying traditional arts and crafts from early childhood.
